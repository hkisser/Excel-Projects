## Introduction & Problem
I had read quite a number of books in the year 2022 ,there were some I had completed and some I was half way through and some I had downloaded and was planing on reading but I felt organisation was a bit messed up in my head.This was a major problem for me and I knew I had to do something about it fast

## The Data

Well the data was self generated,what I mean is that I did not have to search online to get the data,I had to put together all the books I meant to read this year.I would say that was a lot of work because I reaslised I had actually planned on reading over 30 books this year.I had to go through all the books I had downloaded this year and make enter those titles into an Excel Sheet


## Tech Stack
- Excel
- Critical Thinking


## Analysis
After putting together the book titles,I had to categorise them under completed,pending,not started.I utilised pivot tables and charts to get a sense of what I was working with 


Simple design to keep track of books read
