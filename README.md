## Introduction & Problem

This research arose from my desire to learn which countries were responsible for generating the majority of the world's oil. With the continuous conflict between Ukraine and Russia, as well as massive price increases in oil and gas in my home nation,Ghana, I wanted to learn how significant Russia's contribution to the oil industry was.

## Tech Stack

- Excel
- Googling
- Critical Thinking

## The Data

I obtained the data from the Information is Beautiful website, and the visual concept was inspired by one I saw on the site, so I wanted to duplicate it in Excel.

## Analysis

To visualize the data, I used a TreeMap Chart.

## Results

After some tinkering, I was able to complete the graph.

The United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia generated the greatest proportion of oil.

With Russia out of the picture, the rest of the globe was highly reliant on the remaining countries to produce.

This resulted in increased demand for these products.
