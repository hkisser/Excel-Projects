## Introduction & Problem

I had read quite a number of books in the year 2022 ,there were some I had completed and some I was half way through and some I had downloaded and was planning on reading but I felt I had not really put any order in the books I set out to read.This was a major problem for me and I knew I had to do something about it fast.

## The Data

The data was self-generated, which means I did not have to seek online for it; instead, I had to compile a list of all the books I planned to read in the year 2022. That was a lot of work, because I realized I had planned to read more than 30 books this year. I had to go through all of the books I downloaded the past few months and enter their titles into an Excel spreadsheet.

- Excel
- Critical Thinking


## Analysis

After compiling the book titles, I had to categorize them as completed, pending, or not started. To gain a sense of what I was dealing with, I used pivot tables and charts.

## Results

After all of the insane analysis, I finally put together a dashboard that I could use to track my readings and improve my reading habits.

## Recommendation

I realized I was multitasking on quite a few books and had a lot of books unread, so based on the analysis, my new objective was to finish the books with the pending status before tackling the rest.
This meant that I was able to complete the books I had begun to read.
